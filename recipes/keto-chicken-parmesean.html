        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 egg
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
            </li>
            <li>1.5 ounces pork rinds, crushed
            </li>
            <li>1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
            </li>
            <li>½ cup jarred tomato sauce (such as Rao's®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
            </li>
            <li>Slice chicken breast through the middle horizontally from one side to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Pound chicken flat until about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Beat egg and cream together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine crushed pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, ground black pepper, and Italian seasoning in bowl; transfer breading to a plate.</li>
            <li>Dip chicken into egg mixture; coat completely. Press chicken into breading; thickly coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add ghee. Place chicken in the pan; cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Be careful to keep breading in place.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Cover with tomato sauce; top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Broil until cheese is bubbling and barely browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
